# RPI Campus Map
### This is a continuation of a project in the RPI's principles of software where I:
- Translated the original Java application into Python
- Created a Python generic graph ADT
- Used model-view-controller software design pattern

### What I'm working on right now:
- Creating a GUI with html and run by PyScript
- Attempting to deploy this project on Github Pages
